      "q1": "What is {{brandName}} Pharmacy Platform?",
      "a1": "{{brandName}} Pharmacy Platform is a comprehensive online pharmacy service that provides affordable medications to customers nationwide. We work directly with manufacturers to offer medications at transparent prices without the markup that traditional pharmacies charge. Our mission is to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for everyone.",
      "q2": "How does {{brandName}} Pharmacy Platform offer such low prices?",
      "a2": "We cut out the middlemen and work directly with medication manufacturers to secure the best possible prices. We operate on a transparent pricing model with a fixed markup on all medications. This approach allows us to offer prescription medications at substantially lower prices than traditional pharmacies.",
      "q3": "Where do you ship medications?",
      "a3": "We currently ship to all 50 U.S. states and territories. All medications are shipped from our U.S.-based pharmacy partners using reliable shipping carriers to ensure your medications arrive safely and promptly.",
      "q4": "How do I submit my prescription?",
      "a4": "You can submit your prescription in three ways: Upload a photo or scan of your prescription through your account after signing in, ask your doctor to send your prescription directly to our pharmacy, or request a transfer from your current pharmacy to ours. Our team will verify your prescription and process your order once received.",
      "q5": "How long will it take to receive my medication?",
      "a5": "Most orders are processed within 1-2 business days after your prescription is verified. Standard shipping typically takes 3-5 business days. Expedited shipping options are available at checkout. You can track your order at any time through your account dashboard.",
      "q6": "Can I get my medications automatically refilled?",
      "a6": "Yes, we offer an automatic refill program for eligible prescriptions. You can opt into this service during checkout or from your account settings. We'll notify you before each refill is processed so you can make changes if needed.",
      "q7": "Do you accept insurance?",
      "a7": "Yes, we accept most major insurance plans. During checkout, you can enter your insurance information to see if your medication is covered. In many cases, our direct prices may be lower than your insurance copay. We'll always show you both options so you can choose the most affordable one.",
      "q8": "What payment methods do you accept?",
      "a8": "We accept all major credit and debit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. We also support Apple Pay and Google Pay for convenient checkout. For prescription medications, payment is collected after your prescription has been verified.",
      "q9": "Can I use HSA or FSA accounts to pay for my medications?",
      "a9": "Yes, you can use your Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA) to pay for prescription medications on our platform. Simply use your HSA/FSA card during checkout, or submit your receipt to your account administrator for reimbursement.",
      "q10": "How is my personal and health information protected?",
      "a10": "We take privacy and security seriously. Our platform employs industry-standard encryption protocols to secure your personal and health information. We are fully HIPAA-compliant and will never share your information with third parties without your explicit consent. For more details, please review our Privacy Policy.",
      "q11": "Can I manage prescriptions for my family members?",
      "a11": "Yes, you can manage prescriptions for family members through our family account feature. After creating your account, you can add family members and manage their prescriptions with appropriate consent. Each family member will have their own secure profile within your account.",
      "q12": "What if I need to speak with a pharmacist?",
      "a12": "Our licensed pharmacists are available for consultation Monday through Friday, 8am-8pm EST, and Saturday 9am-5pm EST. You can contact them through the secure messaging feature in your account, by email, or by phone. Pharmacists can answer questions about your medications, potential interactions, and proper usage."
